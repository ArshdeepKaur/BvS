# BvS
An Image classifier to identify whether the given image is Batman or Superman.

## Building a simple Neural Network:

**Step 1:** Prepare the image data & preprocess it.


**Step 2:** Convert Images into Data matrices.


**Step 3:** Create a Neural Network Tensorflow graph.


**Step 4:** Train the model using the data matrices.


**Step 5:** Test the model that was created with a new set of data.
